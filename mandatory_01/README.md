<b>1) What is the time complexity of InsertSort and BubbleSort in Big-O notation? </b><br>
BubbleSort and Insertsort both result in Big-O notation: O(n^2).
<br>
<br>
<b>2) One of the algorithms is noticeably faster than the other. Which is the faster one?</b><br>
The fastest one is Insertsort, and we can see that by analysing result.
<br>
<br>
<b>3) What causes the difference in performance?</b><br>
BubbleSort is doing more calculations than InsertSort, and therefore cause difference in performance<br>
This is because BubbleSort compares first element with second element and check if element A is greater than B, swap if , else nothing.<br>
While InsertionSort split the array to a  (sorted | unsorted ) partition. You check if the unsorted number is greater than the sorted number and place it where it fits in the index for sorted numbers.
